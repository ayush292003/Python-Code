### Just a rather intelligent Complete Password Tool.

# Creates Passwords for you.

-  Uses a self developed non-predictable generic sequence generating algorithm to generate ultra-strong passwords.
-  Upon the request for strong password, it generates random number of equal length password sequences and then select the required length of password sequence from each of the generated sequences.
-  This incorporates unpredictability and decreases chances of brute forcing passwords.

# Checks your old password's strength.

-  Using regex queries
